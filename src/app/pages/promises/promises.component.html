      <h3 class="fs-4 fw-bold">Methodology</h3>
      <p class="fs-6">
        Our analysis benchmarks promises against the original 2024 manifesto and tracks their progress based on
        government reports,
        legislative updates, and public data. Legislative adjustments post-2024 have been considered to ensure

      <h3 class="fs-4 fw-bold">Detailed Evaluation</h3>
      <ul class="fs-6 ">
        <li>
          <strong>Garib Parivar Jan:</strong> Significant progress in housing and free ration distribution was observed.
          However,
          the rollout of the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana for free electricity remains limited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nari Shakti:</strong> Progress has been commendable in legal reforms and rural entrepreneurship;
          however, gaps
          in women’s workforce participation still exist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Youth Opportunities:</strong> While startup funding and mentoring have shown significant results, the
          government
          is yet to meet targets for new educational institutions in Tier-3 cities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kisan Samman:</strong> Promises like doubling farmers’ income and launching Krishi Satellite have seen
          limited
          progress despite advances in MSP hikes.
